            <h3>Here’s how to make food help you get fit</h3>
            <p>Looking for a diet plan for weight loss? Fitness experts say 5-6 meals rich in carbs and proteins in a
                day, and
                proper exercises, will ensure that you achieve your weight loss goals.Sometimes you pay Rs 2,000 a month
                thinking that the money paid will motivate you to get to the gym. And at times, after paying the money,
                a month
                goes by and you realise you’ve just visited the gym twice. Maybe you find the gym routine boring or
                maybe you
                just aren’t getting enough time to go there.</p>
