            <h3>Here’s how to make food help you get fit</h3>
            <p>Looking for a diet plan for weight loss? Fitness experts say 5-6 meals rich in carbs and proteins in a
                day, and
                proper exercises, will ensure that you achieve your weight loss goals.Sometimes you pay Rs 2,000 a month
                thinking that the money paid will motivate you to get to the gym. And at times, after paying the money,
                a month
                goes by and you realise you’ve just visited the gym twice. Maybe you find the gym routine boring or
                maybe you
                just aren’t getting enough time to go there.</p>

            <p><b>Breakfast:</b> A protein rich breakfast is a must.

                An experiment by the University of Missouri involving 20 overweight females between the ages of 18 and
                20
                proved that a high protein breakfast led to reduced cravings and they also snacked less on unhealthy
                foods.Moong dal parantha, sprouted moong with poha or upma, muesli or flakes with fruits and seeds or
                oats idlis, eggs in different forms, peanut butter sandwich with a glass of milk or fresh fruit juice.

            </p>
            <p><b>Mid-morning snack: </b>Fruits with buttermilk or green tea. “Green tea increases fat burning and
                improves physical performance. It can lower your risk of Type 2 diabetes, risk of cardiovascular disease
                and help you lose weight and lessen your risk of obesity,” explains Singh.</p>
            <p><b>Lunch:</b> Homemade dal or legumes, roti, veggies with soup and green salad and raita or curd.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Early-evening snack:</b> Protein shake, nuts and seeds, veg sandwich or milk and apple. Researchers
                at
                Pennsylvania State University conducted a study which proved that nuts such as almonds have
                anti-cholesterol
                benefits and hence should be included in your diet.
            </p>
            <p><b>Dinner:</b> Dal, veggies, with brown rice or roti and vegetable soup. And you should keep in mind that
                a
                light dinner is important, since the digestive system should get rest at night.</p>

            <h1 class="fs">Eat in <span class="orange"> moderation</span></h1>
            <p>There is no point depriving yourself of food. The mantra is to
                ‘ <a class="link-button2" target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.hearnkirkwood.com/news/2020/2/21/6-tips-for-practicing-eating-in-moderation">Eat
                    in moderation</a> ’.
            <p>Use less oil or ghee in vegetables, dal, etc. Indian homemade food is the best
                dietary plan — roti, vegetables, poha, idli, buttermilk, coconut water are all excellent choices.
                Moderate amounts of rice, controlled portion of ghee daily and once a while homemade fried food such as
                puri, bhajiya and vada can be tried. These foods give you the energy your body needs.</p>

            <p>Avoid all junk foods, be it Indian or western. Samosas, kachori, pizza, donuts are all equally bad.
                Foods with added sugars, and processed foods that contain high amount of trans-fats should be avoided.
